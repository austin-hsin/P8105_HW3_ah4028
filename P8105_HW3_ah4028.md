## Problem 0

Setup code for assignment - including p8105 datasets library

## Problem 1

Here we are exploring the `instacart` dataset.

``` r
instacart |> 
  count(aisle) |> 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ℹ 124 more rows

The `instacart` dataset has 15 variables with 1,384,617 separate entry
orders, identified by `order_id`, `product-id`, and `product_name`,
further specified by `aisle_id` and `aisle` name, as well as
`department`. It has 1384617 rows and 15 columns, with each row
identifying a single item per order. In total, there are 39123 products
found in 131209 orders from 131209 distinct users.\*

There are 134 different aisles with `fresh vegetables`, `fresh fruits`,
and `packaged vegetables fruits` as the top three aisles bought from
with 150609, 150473, and 78493 items bought respectively.

Here we plot the number of items ordered in each aisle in ascending
order.

``` r
instacart |> 
  count(aisle) |> 
  filter(n > 10000) |> 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

Next we plot the three most popular items in aisles
`baking ingredients`, `dog food care`, and `packaged vegetables fruits`,
and includes the number of times each item is ordered.

``` r
instacart |> 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) |>
  group_by(aisle) |> 
  count(product_name) |> 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) |> 
  filter(rank < 4) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |

Lastly, we plot the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and
Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week. Pink Lady Apples
are generally purchased slightly earlier in the day than Coffee Ice
Cream, with the exception of day 5.

``` r
instacart |>
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) |>
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) |>
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow, 
    values_from = mean_hour) |>
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

## Problem 2

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
```
