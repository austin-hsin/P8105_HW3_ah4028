## Problem 0

Setup code for assignment - including p8105 datasets library

## Problem 1

Here we are exploring the `instacart` dataset.

The `instacart` dataset has 15 variables with 1,384,617 separate entry
orders, identified by `order_id`, `product-id`, and `product_name`,
further specified by `aisle_id` and `aisle` name, as well as
`department`. It has 1384617 rows and 15 columns, with each row
identifying a single item per order. In total, there are 39123 products
found in 131209 orders from 131209 distinct users.\*

There are 134 different aisles with `fresh vegetables`, `fresh fruits`,
and `packaged vegetables fruits` as the top three aisles bought from
with 150609, 150473, and 78493 items bought respectively.

Here we plot the number of items ordered in each aisle in ascending
order.

Next we plot the three most popular items in aisles
`baking ingredients`, `dog food care`, and `packaged vegetables fruits`,
and includes the number of times each item is ordered.

``` r
instacart |> 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) |>
  group_by(aisle) |> 
  count(product_name) |> 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) |> 
  filter(rank < 4) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |

Lastly, we plot the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and
Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week. Pink Lady Apples
are generally purchased slightly earlier in the day than Coffee Ice
Cream, with the exception of day 5.

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

## Problem 2

First we clean the BRFSS dataset.

In 2002, there were 6 states that were observed at 7 or more locations
whereas in 2010 there were 14 states.

Next we create and plot a constricted dataframe from our cleaned BRFSS
datatset.

Finally, we will plot the distribution of `prevlance` in NY state for
years 2006 and 2010.
