## Problem 0

Setup code for assignment - including p8105 datasets library

## Problem 1

1.  Here we are exploring the `instacart` dataset.

The `instacart` dataset has 15 variables with 1,384,617 separate entry
orders, identified by `order_id`, `product-id`, and `product_name`,
further specified by `aisle_id` and `aisle` name, as well as
`department`. It has 1384617 rows and 15 columns, with each row
identifying a single item per order. In total, there are 39123 products
found in 131209 orders from 131209 distinct users.\*

There are 134 different aisles with `fresh vegetables`, `fresh fruits`,
and `packaged vegetables fruits` as the top three aisles bought from
with 150609, 150473, and 78493 items bought respectively.

2.  Here we plot the number of items ordered in each aisle in ascending
    order.

3.  Next we plot the three most popular items in aisles
    `baking ingredients`, `dog food care`, and
    `packaged vegetables fruits`, and includes the number of times each
    item is ordered.

``` r
instacart |> 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) |>
  group_by(aisle) |> 
  count(product_name) |> 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) |> 
  filter(rank < 4) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |

4.  Lastly, we plot the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
    and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week. Pink Lady
    Apples are generally purchased slightly earlier in the day than
    Coffee Ice Cream, with the exception of day 5.

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

## Problem 2

1.  First we clean the BRFSS dataset.

In 2002, there were 6 states that were observed at 7 or more locations
whereas in 2010 there were 14 states.

2.  Next we create and plot a constricted dataframe from our cleaned
    BRFSS datatset.

<img src="P8105_HW3_ah4028_files/figure-gfm/`brfss_df plot`-1.png" width="90%" />

3.  Finally, we will plot the distribution of `Response` in NY state for
    years 2006 and 2010.

## Problem 3

1.  Here we load, tidy, merge, and organize the NHANES MIMS demographic
    and accelerometer datasets.

2.  Next we display the number of men and women in each education
    category.

| sex    | education             |   n |
|:-------|:----------------------|----:|
| female | Less than Highschool  |  28 |
| female | Highschool Equivalent |  23 |
| female | More than Highschool  |  59 |
| male   | Less than Highschool  |  27 |
| male   | Highschool Equivalent |  35 |
| male   | More than Highschool  |  56 |

For the categories less than a high school education and higher than a
high school education, we have similar numbers of male and female.
However, we have a significantly higher number of males who have a high
school education than females at 35 compared to 23.

3.  Similarly, we display the age distributions for men and women in
    each education category.

<img src="P8105_HW3_ah4028_files/figure-gfm/`MIM_age_mf_education`-1.png" width="90%" />

According to the visual of age distribution of male and female by
education level, women 40 and under have a higher prevalence of higher
than high school education compared to 40 and under men who have a
greater number of high school educations. We can also confirm our
previous comment that male across the age range have a more consistent
prevalence of high school educations compared to female who are biased
towards higher than highschool until the 60-80 age range.

4.  Next, we aggregate activity and plot total activity against age.

``` r
# Creating total_activity variable and plotting it against age and sex
MIMS_tidy |>
  mutate(
    total_activity = rowSums(across(c(min1:min1440)))) |>
  select(-c(min1:min1440))|>
  group_by(sex)|>
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = total_activity, color = sex)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(.~education) +
  labs(title = "Total Activity by Age Stratified by Education and Sex") 
```

<img src="P8105_HW3_ah4028_files/figure-gfm/`total_activity by age and sex`-1.png" width="90%" />

According to the plot, `total_activity` decreases as age increases
regardless of sex. In the less than highschool subset, males had a
higher average total activity, with the exception of those aged 40 and
under where females had a higher average. The opposite held true in the
highschool equivalent and more than highschool subsets where females had
higher average total activity across the entire age range.

5.  Finally, we plot total activity over the recorded 24 hour period.

``` r
# Plotting activity for Less than Highschool subset
MIMS_tidy |>
  pivot_longer(
    min1:min1440,
    names_to = "minutes",
    values_to = "activity")|>
ggplot(aes(x = minutes , y = activity, color = sex)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = sex), alpha = 0.25, size = 0.8) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(.~education) +
  labs(title = "24 Hour Activity Stratified by Education and Sex") +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

<img src="P8105_HW3_ah4028_files/figure-gfm/`24hr_activity by education and sex`-1.png" width="90%" />

From the smooth trend lines, there does not seem to be any significant
differences across the education subsets. Similarly, the plot does not
show any significant dips in activity for sleeping, which can be
attributed to the variety of sleep schedules this participant group has.
